# Rideshare-Local-App
#### This project includes the files used to develop a rideshare cost estimator for Chciago.  The ML algorithm was developed as a separate project and the parameters of the model were stored in a pickle file and called in model.py.  The purpose of this repository is to test locally the potential to use a reverse geocoding library that would allow the project to use Chicago defined communities as inputs to the model.  With a small change to a geocoding library, this app is able to include this info into the model.  This repository is also used to test the methods used to add current estimators into the model and to test changes to the ML algorithm before being deployed to the Heroku Flask App (rideshare-flask-app, https://github.com/ejw-data/rideshare-flask-app.git).

#### This app does not use a database.  The inputs to the machine learning algorithm are pulled from the server time and API calls to mapquest, openweather, and google locations.  These inputs provide estimators for the time, date, start longitude, end longitude, estimated directions with distance and time estimates, and a variety of weather data.  The inputs were also manipulated to determine the taxes applied based on the Chicago tax regions (longitude/latitude calculation) and community zones (reverse geocoding).
